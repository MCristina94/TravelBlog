# Travel's Blog

This project consists of a website that consumes the public APIs of Pexels https://www.pexels.com/api/ and RestCountries https://restcountries.com/, displaying a gallery of photos from different cities and countries. Additionally, users can search for any photo they want by entering the name of a city or country, or even any type of information, and the system will return a travel-related image that matches the search. Users can also view cards of different countries with relevant information and search by currency, language, capital, or country name.

The app includes three links: Home (main page with country cards), Pictures (image gallery with search functionality), Countries Information (various country details with search options), and About this page (information about the project).
